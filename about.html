I have always been the go-to-guy in my family who fixes tech, be it computers, mobile phones, etc. This inquisitive nature kept me motivated throughout my undergrad, which led me to pursue my Masters here at the University of Cincinnati.

As a tech enthusiast, I have always been fond of fiddling with technology and learning new things. I love finding creative solutions to problems and that has always been the driving force for the projects I do.

I have developed my software development skills through developing several projects on multiple platforms using Django, Java, C, HTML, CSS, etc.
